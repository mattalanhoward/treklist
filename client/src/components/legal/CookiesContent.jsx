          This page explains which cookies we use, why we use them, and how you
          can control them. We use essential cookies to keep TrekList running
          (for example, login and security), and optional analytics cookies if
          you choose to allow them. We don&apos;t currently use marketing or
          advertising cookies on TrekList.co.

        This Cookie Policy explains how TrekList.co (&quot;
        <strong>TrekList</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>we</strong>&quot;, &quot;
        <strong>us</strong>&quot;) uses cookies and similar technologies on our
        website and app.
      </p>

      <p>
        For more information about how we handle your personal data in general,

      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">1. What are cookies?</h2>

      <p>
        Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer,
        tablet, phone) when you visit a website. They are widely used to make
        websites work, improve user experience, and provide information to site
        owners.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similar technologies (such as local storage, pixels, and tags) may serve
        the same purpose. In this policy, we refer to all of these as
        &quot;cookies&quot;.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">2. Who sets cookies?</h2>

      <p>Cookies on TrekList.co may be:</p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>
          <strong>First-party cookies</strong> – set by TrekList itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third-party cookies</strong> – set by other services we use
          (e.g. analytics providers).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In addition, when you click on an <strong>affiliate link</strong> on
        TrekList or Tall Joe Hikes, the destination website or affiliate network
        may set its own cookies. These cookies are controlled by those third
        parties, not by TrekList. Please refer to their privacy and cookie
        policies for more information.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">3. Types of cookies we use</h2>

      <p>We group the cookies we use into the following categories:</p>

      <h3 className="font-semibold mt-3">
        3.1 Essential (strictly necessary) cookies
      </h3>

      <p>
        These cookies are necessary for TrekList to function and cannot be
        switched off through our Cookie Settings.
      </p>

      <p>They are usually set in response to actions you take, such as:</p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Logging in or out.</li>
        <li>Maintaining your session while you move around the app.</li>
        <li>Remembering your security and privacy preferences.</li>
        <li>Preventing fraud or abuse.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Without these cookies, TrekList may not work properly and certain
        features (like login) may not be available.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Legal basis:</strong> our legitimate interest in providing a
        secure, functioning service and/or performance of the contract (Art.
        6(1)(b) and 6(1)(f) GDPR).
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-semibold mt-3">3.2 Analytics cookies (optional)</h3>

      <p>
        If you consent, we use analytics cookies or similar technologies to
        understand how TrekList is used, for example:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Which pages are visited most often.</li>
        <li>Which features are used.</li>
        <li>How users reach our site (e.g. from search engines or social).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We use this information in aggregate form to improve TrekList. We do not
        use analytics cookies to show you targeted ads.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Legal basis:</strong> your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).
      </p>

      <p>
        You can enable or disable analytics cookies at any time via our{" "}
        <strong>Cookie Settings</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-semibold mt-3">3.3 Marketing and tracking cookies</h3>

      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> currently use our own marketing or
        advertising cookies on TrekList.co.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, when you click an <strong>affiliate link</strong> from TrekList
        or Tall Joe Hikes, the destination website or affiliate network may set
        cookies to:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>
          Track that a purchase came from our link (so they can attribute a
          commission).
        </li>
        <li>Remember your actions on their site.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These cookies are controlled by those third parties. Please refer to
        their privacy and cookie policies for details on how they use cookies
        and how you can manage them.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">
        4. Managing your cookie preferences
      </h2>

      <p>You have several ways to control cookies:</p>

      <h3 className="font-semibold mt-3">4.1 Cookie Settings on TrekList</h3>

      <p>On TrekList, you can manage non-essential cookies via:</p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>
          The <strong>Cookie Settings</strong> tab in our Legal &amp; Cookies
          modal, and/or
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>/legal/cookie-settings</strong> page.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>There you can:</p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Enable or disable analytics cookies.</li>
        <li>Accept all or reject non-essential cookies.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Your choices are stored in a cookie consent preference (for example,{" "}
        <code>cookieConsent_v1</code>) so we can remember your settings.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-semibold mt-3">4.2 Browser settings</h3>

      <p>
        You can also control cookies at the browser level. Most browsers allow
        you to:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Block or delete cookies entirely.</li>
        <li>Block cookies from specific sites.</li>
        <li>Receive a warning before cookies are stored.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Please note that if you block essential cookies, TrekList may not
        function properly and you may not be able to log in or use certain
        features.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-semibold mt-3">
        4.3 Third-party cookies (affiliate sites)
      </h3>

      <p>
        When you click on an affiliate link, the destination website or
        affiliate network may place its own cookies. You can usually manage
        these via:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>The cookie banner on that website.</li>
        <li>The cookie or privacy settings of that website.</li>
        <li>Your browser&apos;s cookie settings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">
        5. How long do cookies stay on my device?
      </h2>

      <p>Cookies can be:</p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>
          <strong>Session cookies</strong> – deleted when you close your
          browser.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Persistent cookies</strong> – stay on your device for a
          defined period or until you delete them.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We aim to keep cookie lifetimes reasonable and in line with their
        purpose. Analytics cookies, if used, are typically set for a limited
        period (for example up to 13 months), depending on the provider.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">
        6. Changes to this Cookie Policy
      </h2>

        add or change the cookies we use.
